# mechanical-watch-epaper-display
Code for ESP32 prototype mechanically powered and controlled watch epaper display.

Hobby project to learn about electronics, ESP32, low energy components and mechanical watches.

For now, the idea is only to try to prove the concept, that is possible to power a very small (still non-existent) epaper display and accompanying circuit to show hours and minutes (hh24:mi) using only the power generated from a watch barrel (mainspring).
