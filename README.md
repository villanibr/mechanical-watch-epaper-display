# mechanical-watch-epaper-display
Code for a mechanically powered and controlled watch epaper display prototype.

Hobby project to learn about electronics, ESP32, STM32, epaper displays, low energy components and mechanical watches. Inspired on Grand Seiko Spring Drive movement.

For now, the idea is only to try to prove the concept, that is possible to power a very small (still non-existent) epaper display and accompanying circuit to show hours and minutes (hh24:mi) using only the power generated from one or more watch barrels (mainsprings).

Code made using Visual Studio Code + Platform IO (Arduino framework) + several references.
